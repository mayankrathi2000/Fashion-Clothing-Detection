# Fashion-Clothing-Detection
`Fashion-MNIST` is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of `60,000` examples and a test set of `10,000` examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. `Fashion-MNIST` serves as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits.
